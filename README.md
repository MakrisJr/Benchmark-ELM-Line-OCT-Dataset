### To create the environment:
`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

### File guide: 
- dataset.py: BasicDataset class, returns {image, mask} items
- dice_loss.py: implements dice coefficient and dice loss


## Utilities

- stack_to_tif.py: stack 2D mask images (e.g., from `result/`) into a 3D multi-page TIF named `<name>_seg.tif` compatible with `holes_detection.py` and `line_check.py`.

### Export a 3D _seg.tif from 2D predictions

After running `predict.py`, masks are saved as individual 2D images under `result/`. To analyze them with `holes_detection.py` or `line_check.py`, stack them into a multi-page TIF:

```
python stack_to_tif.py --input-dir result --output IMAGES/EBU_seg.tif
```

Notes:
- Images are sorted in natural numeric order to form the z-stack.
- Output volume shape is [Z, H, W]. If predictions were resized (e.g., 256x256), the stacked TIF will have that size.


- holes_detection.py: standalone utility, 


image 605-19 is missing, I have copied 605-18 as a temporary fix
same for 389-24 + 1 more 389 slice
